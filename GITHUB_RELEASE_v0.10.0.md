# 🚀 SentryVibe v0.10.0 - Real-Time Revolution

**The biggest architectural upgrade since SentryVibe's launch!** This release transforms build tracking from fragile to rock-solid with WebSocket real-time updates.

---

## ✨ Major Features

### 🔌 WebSocket Real-Time Updates
Say goodbye to lost builds and data corruption! The new WebSocket architecture provides:

- **✅ Seamless Page Refresh** - Refresh anytime, builds resume instantly
- **✅ Navigate Freely** - Switch between projects without losing build state  
- **✅ Multi-Tab Support** - Watch the same build from multiple browser tabs
- **✅ Auto-Reconnection** - Network hiccup? Automatically reconnects with exponential backoff
- **✅ 100% Completion** - Builds reliably complete to 100%, no more stuck at 99%

### 📡 Connection Status Indicator
Visual feedback shows your connection state:
- 🟡 "Reconnecting..." during brief disconnects
- 🔴 "Connection error" with retry button if issues occur
- (Hidden when connected - no noise when everything's working!)

### 📊 90% Network Traffic Reduction
Smart batching reduces events from ~500-1000 per build to ~50-100 messages.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- ✅ **Page refresh data corruption** - Completely eliminated
- ✅ **Navigation state loss** - Fixed with database hydration
- ✅ **Agent metadata undefined** - Now persists through all scenarios
- ✅ **Builds stuck at 99%** - Reliably completes to 100%
- ✅ **Tool call duplication** - Eliminated with deduplication logic
- ✅ **Date crashes** - Fixed `endTime.getTime is not a function`
- ✅ **Wrong todo tool assignment** - Tools always nested correctly
- ✅ **Dropped batch updates** - Never lose updates during race conditions

## 🛠️ Breaking Changes

### Custom Server Required

**Old**:
```bash
next dev
```

**New**:
```bash
pnpm dev  # Custom server with WebSocket
```

**Why**: WebSocket needs HTTP server access (not exposed in default Next.js)

**Fallback Available**:
```bash
pnpm dev:next  # Standard Next.js (if WebSocket issues)
```
