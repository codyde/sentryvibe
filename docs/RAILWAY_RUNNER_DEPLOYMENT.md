```

**Key Points:**
- Runner connects to broker via **public WebSocket URL**
- Runner needs **persistent volume** at `/data/workspace`
- Health checks on port **8080** (HTTP)
- Uses same `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` as broker

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Existing Railway Project** with:
   - Web service (sentryvibe Next.js app) - deployed
   - Broker service (sentryvibe-broker) - deployed
   - Shared secret configured (`RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET`)

2. **GitHub Repository** pushed with latest changes

3. **Railway CLI** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   ```

---

## Step 1: Create Runner Service

### Option A: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended for First Time)

1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.app/project/[your-project]
2. Click **"+ New Service"**
3. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
4. Choose your `sentryvibe` repository
5. Railway will detect the Dockerfile automatically

### Option B: Via Railway CLI

```bash
cd /path/to/sentryvibe
railway link  # Link to your existing project
railway up --service runner
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Build Settings

In Railway service settings:

### **Root Directory**
- Set to: `/` (monorepo root)

### **Dockerfile Path**
- Set to: `apps/runner/Dockerfile`

### **Build Command** (if not using Dockerfile)
Skip this if using the Dockerfile (it handles builds internally)

### **Start Command** (override if needed)
```bash
node apps/runner/dist/index.js runner
```

---

## Step 3: Add Persistent Volume

**Critical**: The runner needs persistent storage for project workspaces.

1. In Railway service settings, go to **"Volumes"** tab
2. Click **"+ New Volume"**
3. Configure:
   - **Mount Path:** `/data/workspace`
   - **Size:** 10 GB (start small, increase as needed)
4. Click **"Add Volume"**

**Cost:** ~$0.25/GB/month (~$2.50/month for 10GB)

**Why needed:**
- Stores AI-generated project code
- Persists `node_modules/` across builds
- Required for dev servers to run

---

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Add these to the runner service (Railway Settings → Variables):

### **Required Variables:**

```env
# Runner Identity (unique per instance)
RUNNER_ID=railway-runner-prod

# Authentication (must match broker's secret)
RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET=${{shared.RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET}}

# Broker Connection (use your broker's public URL)
RUNNER_BROKER_URL=wss://your-broker.up.railway.app/socket

# API Endpoint (use your web app's public URL)
API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Workspace Location (matches volume mount)
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/data/workspace

# Service Mode (disables TUI, enables health endpoint)
NODE_ENV=production

# Health Check Port
HEALTH_PORT=8080
```

### **Optional Variables:**

```env
# Enable verbose build logging
DEBUG_BUILD=1

# Sentry Configuration (if using)
SENTRY_DSN=https://...
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
SENTRY_RELEASE=${{RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA}}

# Anthropic API Key (for AI builds)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${{shared.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}}
```

### **How to Get Your URLs:**

1. **Broker URL:**
   - Go to broker service → Settings → Domains
   - Copy the Railway-provided domain
   - Format: `wss://[your-broker-domain].railway.app/socket`

2. **Web App URL:**
   - Go to web service → Settings → Domains
   - Copy the Railway-provided domain
   - Format: `https://[your-app-domain].railway.app`

---

## Step 5: Configure Shared Secrets

If you haven't already created a shared secret:

1. Go to Railway project settings (not service settings)
2. Click **"Shared Variables"** tab
3. Add:
   ```
   RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET=[generate-random-token]
   ```

Generate a secure token:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

This same secret must be used by:
- Broker service
- Runner service(s)
- Web app (if calling runner APIs directly)

---

## Step 6: Deploy

1. **Push changes** to GitHub (includes updated runner code)
2. Railway will **auto-deploy** when it detects changes
3. Monitor logs:
   ```bash
   railway logs --service runner
   ```

### Expected Startup Logs:

```
📁 Creating workspace directory: /data/workspace
✅ Health endpoint listening on port 8080
[runner] workspace root: /data/workspace
[runner] api base url: https://your-app.railway.app
[runner] runner id: railway-runner-prod
🤝 Connecting to broker: wss://your-broker.railway.app/socket
🎉 Connected to broker!
[runner] ⏱️  Heartbeat sent: railway-runner-prod
```

---

## Step 7: Verify Health

### Check Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://your-runner.railway.app/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "runner": {
    "id": "railway-runner-prod",
    "connected": true,
    "workspace": "/data/workspace",
    "workspaceExists": true
  },
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-26T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

### Check Readiness (for k8s-style readiness probes)

```bash
curl https://your-runner.railway.app/ready
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "runnerId": "railway-runner-prod"
}
```

**Not Ready (503):**
```json
{
  "ready": false,
  "runnerId": "railway-runner-prod"
}
```

---

## Step 8: Test the Runner

1. **Check Web App UI:**
   - Open SentryVibe web interface
   - Look in sidebar footer → Runner dropdown
   - Your Railway runner should appear: `railway-runner-prod` with green dot

2. **Create a Test Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Enter prompt: "Create a simple hello world React app"
   - Ensure runner is selected
   - Submit

3. **Monitor Runner Logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs --service runner --tail
   ```

You should see:
   - Build command received
   - AI streaming started
   - Files being written
   - Dependencies installed
   - Build completed

4. **Verify Workspace Persistence:**
   - SSH into Railway container (if needed):
     ```bash
     railway run --service runner bash
     ls -la /data/workspace
     ```
   - Should see project directories

---

## Scaling: Multiple Runners

### Deploy Additional Runners

To add more runners (e.g., for different regions or load distribution):

1. **Duplicate the runner service** in Railway
2. **Give unique RUNNER_ID**:
   ```env
   RUNNER_ID=railway-runner-us-west
   ```
3. **Add separate volume** (each runner needs its own)
4. **Same broker/API URLs**

### Load Distribution

Runners self-register with the broker when they connect. The web app's runner selector dropdown will show all connected runners. Users can choose which runner to use for each project.

**Future Enhancement**: Implement automatic load balancing in broker (distribute commands round-robin across healthy runners).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Runner Not Appearing in UI

**Check:**
1. Runner logs show "Connected to broker"
2. Broker logs show runner connection
3. `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` matches between services
4. WebSocket URL is correct (wss:// not ws://)

**Debug:**
```bash
railway logs --service runner | grep -i "connect\|error"
railway logs --service broker | grep -i "runner\|connect"
```

### Issue: "No workspace directory" Error

**Check:**
1. Volume is mounted at `/data/workspace`
2. `WORKSPACE_ROOT=/data/workspace` in env vars
3. Container has write permissions

**Fix:**
```bash
# SSH into container
railway run --service runner bash
# Check mount
df -h | grep workspace
# Check permissions
ls -la /data/
```

### Issue: Dev Servers Won't Start

**Check:**
1. Port allocation in database matches what runner tries to use
2. No port conflicts in container
3. Workspace has project files

**Debug:**
```bash
railway logs --service runner | grep -i "port\|dev server"
```

### Issue: Builds Fail with "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"

**Fix:**
Add to runner environment variables:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${{shared.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}}
```

Make sure it's defined in shared variables.

### Issue: Runner Keeps Disconnecting

**Check:**
1. Broker heartbeat timeout (90 seconds)
2. Runner ping/pong working (30 second interval)
3. Network stability

**Railway logs:**
```bash
railway logs --service runner | grep -i "timeout\|disconnect\|reconnect"
```

### Issue: Out of Disk Space

**Check volume usage:**
```bash
railway run --service runner -- du -sh /data/workspace/*
```

**Solutions:**
- Increase volume size (Railway settings)
- Delete old projects from workspace
- Implement cleanup policy

---

## Cost Estimation

### Per Runner Service:

- **Compute**: $5-10/month (based on usage)
- **Volume (10GB)**: ~$2.50/month
- **Total**: ~$7.50-12.50/month per runner

### Recommended Setup:

- **1 runner for personal use**: ~$10/month
- **2-3 runners for team**: ~$25-35/month
- **Scaled fleet (5+)**: $50+/month

Compare to running locally:
- Local runner: $0 (uses your machine)
- Railway runner: Always available, no local resources needed

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Start Command

If you need to pass custom flags:

```bash
node apps/runner/dist/index.js runner --heartbeatInterval 20000
```

### Multiple Replicas (Not Recommended)

Railway can deploy multiple replicas of the same service, but:
- ❌ Each needs separate volume (can't share)
- ❌ RUNNER_ID will collide (both get same RAILWAY_REPLICA_ID)
- ✅ Better to deploy separate services with unique IDs

### Internal Networking (Future)

Currently the runner uses **public URLs** to reach broker/API. In the future, you could use Railway's private networking:

```env
# Instead of public URLs:
RUNNER_BROKER_URL=ws://broker.railway.internal:4000/socket
API_BASE_URL=http://web.railway.internal:3000
```

Requires Railway Pro plan ($20/month).

## Maintenance

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Real-time logs
railway logs --service runner --tail

# Filter for errors
railway logs --service runner | grep -i "error\|fail"

# Filter for build activity
railway logs --service runner | grep -i "build"
```

### Restarting Service

```bash
railway service restart --service runner
```

Or via dashboard: Service → Settings → Restart

### Updating Code

```bash
git push origin main
# Railway auto-deploys
```

### Clearing Workspace (Drastic)

If you need to wipe all projects and start fresh:

```bash
railway run --service runner -- rm -rf /data/workspace/*
railway service restart --service runner
```

**Warning**: This deletes all AI-generated projects!

## Migration Checklist

Before deploying to Railway, ensure:

- [x] Broker is deployed and healthy
- [x] Web app is deployed with database
- [x] Shared secret is configured
- [x] Volume is created (10GB minimum)
- [x] Environment variables are set
- [x] Dockerfile exists (apps/runner/Dockerfile)
- [x] Code includes Railway enhancements (RUNNER_ID, health endpoint, etc.)

After deployment:

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Runner appears in UI dropdown with green dot
- [ ] Test build completes successfully
- [ ] Dev server starts and accessible
- [ ] Tunnel creation works
- [ ] Workspace persists across service restarts

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Shared Secret**
- Use Railway's shared variables (encrypted at rest)
- Rotate periodically (update all services simultaneously)
- Never commit to Git

### 2. **API Authentication**
- Runner uses Bearer token for all API calls
- Broker validates token on connection
- Web app validates runner requests

### 3. **Workspace Isolation**
- Each project in separate directory
- No cross-project access
- Files owned by container user

### 4. **Network Security**
- Runner only connects outbound (to broker)
- No inbound connections except health checks
- Tunnel traffic routed through Cloudflare

## Comparison: Local vs Railway Runner

| Aspect | Local Runner | Railway Runner |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Cost** | $0 | ~$10/month |
| **Availability** | Your machine must be on | 24/7 uptime |
| **Resources** | Uses your CPU/RAM | Dedicated container |
| **Workspace** | `~/sentryvibe-workspace` | `/data/workspace` (persistent volume) |
| **Scaling** | Single machine | Can deploy multiple |
| **Access** | localhost only | Accessible from anywhere |
| **Maintenance** | Manual updates | Auto-deploy from Git |
| **TUI Dashboard** | Yes (Ink.js) | No (service mode) |
| **Logs** | Terminal | Railway logs + Sentry |

---

## Next Steps

Once your Railway runner is deployed and healthy:

1. **Set as default runner** in web app (select from dropdown)
2. **Test with real project** (not just hello world)
3. **Monitor costs** in Railway dashboard
4. **Scale if needed** (deploy additional runners for load distribution)
5. **Implement cleanup policy** (delete old projects from workspace)

---
