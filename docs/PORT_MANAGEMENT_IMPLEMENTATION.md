# Port Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive solution to resolve the port management issues you were experiencing with remote runners. The solution addresses all the key problems: ports staying allocated after failed builds, lack of error visibility, and zombie processes holding ports.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Port Utilities (`packages/agent-core/src/lib/port-utils.ts`)

A complete suite of OS-level port management functions:

```typescript
// Check if a port is actually available (not in use)
isPortAvailable(port, host)

// Find all process IDs using a specific port
findProcessesOnPort(port)

// Force-kill all processes on a port
killProcessesOnPort(port)

// Wait for a port to become available with retries
waitForPortAvailable(port, maxRetries, delayMs)

// Find next available port in a range
findAvailablePort(startPort, endPort)
```

### 2. Enhanced Port Allocator (`packages/agent-core/src/lib/port-allocator.ts`)

**Added:**
- OS-level port availability checking before DB reservation
- Force-kill option to automatically free occupied ports
- Three new cleanup functions:
  - `releasePortForProject(projectId)` - Release port for specific project
  - `cleanupStalePortAllocations()` - Clean allocations > 5 minutes old
  - `releaseAllPortAllocations()` - Bulk release for startup

**Enhanced `reservePortForProject()`:**
- Now checks OS-level availability before reserving in DB
- Optional `forceKillIfOccupied` parameter to kill zombie processes
- Prevents race conditions between DB and OS state

### 3. Integrated Cleanup into Process Lifecycle

**Process Exit Cleanup** (`apps/sentryvibe/src/app/api/runner/process/[projectId]/route.ts`):
- When a dev server process exits (gracefully or crash)
- Port allocation is AUTOMATICALLY released
- Critical fix: This was completely missing before!

**Explicit Stop Cleanup** (`apps/sentryvibe/src/app/api/projects/[id]/stop/route.ts`):
- When user stops a dev server
- Port is released immediately
- No waiting for timeout or manual intervention

**Start Preparation** (`apps/sentryvibe/src/app/api/projects/[id]/start/route.ts`):
- Releases any existing port allocation before starting
- Better error messages for port conflicts
- Suggests remediation steps

### 4. Runner Startup & Periodic Cleanup (`apps/runner/src/index.ts`)

**On Runner Startup:**
- Clears ALL port allocations (prevents accumulation from previous crashes)
- Clean slate for each runner session

**Every 5 Minutes:**
- Automatic cleanup of stale allocations
- Checks if ports are actually free at OS level
- Releases mismatched allocations
- Self-healing system

**Enhanced Startup Cleanup** (`packages/agent-core/src/lib/startup-cleanup.ts`):
- Now includes port allocation cleanup
- Coordinated with process cleanup
- Single responsibility for startup health

### 5. Improved Error Messages

**Before:**
```
Error: Failed to start dev server
```

**After:**
```
Port conflict detected. Another process is using the required port. 
Try stopping other dev servers or the system will attempt to use an alternative port.
```

Clear, actionable error messages for common scenarios.

## Key Benefits

### üéØ Automatic Recovery
- Ports are automatically released when processes exit
- No manual intervention needed
- Self-healing system

### üîç Better Visibility
- Clear error messages when conflicts occur
- Logs show what's being cleaned up
- Users know what's happening

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Edge Case Handling
- Handles crashes gracefully
- Cleans up zombie processes
- Prevents stale allocation buildup
- Resolves race conditions

### üöÄ Improved UX
- Users don't need to restart runners constantly
- Failed builds don't block future builds
- System recovers automatically from most issues

## Testing the Solution

### 1. Basic Start/Stop Cycle
```bash
# Start a dev server
# Stop it
# Start it again immediately
# Should work without port conflicts ‚úÖ
```

### 2. Crash Recovery
```bash
# Start a dev server
# Kill the process externally (simulate crash)
# Start it again
# Port should be cleaned up automatically ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Multiple Rapid Starts
```bash
# Try starting the same project multiple times rapidly
# Should handle gracefully, not accumulate stale allocations ‚úÖ
```

### 4. Runner Restart
```bash
# Start some dev servers
# Restart the runner
# All port allocations should be cleared on startup ‚úÖ
```

### 5. Port Conflict Scenario
```bash
# Start an external process on port 3000: `python -m http.server 3000`
# Try to start a dev server that wants port 3000
# Should get clear error message
# Framework should auto-retry on alternative port ‚úÖ
```

## Verification

After deploying, you should see:

1. **Logs on runner startup:**
   ```
   üßπ Cleaning up port allocations...
   ‚úÖ Released X port allocations
   ```

2. **Logs when stopping a dev server:**
   ```
   üîì Releasing port allocation for project abc-123
   ‚úÖ Port released for project abc-123
   ```

3. **Periodic cleanup logs (every 5 min):**
   ```
   üßπ Periodic cleanup: freed X stale port allocations
   ```

4. **When process exits:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Unregistered process for project abc-123
   üîì Releasing port allocation for project abc-123
   ‚úÖ Port released for project abc-123
   ```

## Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality unchanged
- Only adds new cleanup behavior

### Database
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing `port_allocations` table
- Only behavior/query changes

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Cleanup runs async
- Periodic task is lightweight (5-minute interval)
- OS-level port checks are fast (< 500ms timeout)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If ports still appear stuck:

1. **Check runner logs** for cleanup messages
2. **Restart runner** - forces complete cleanup
3. **Check for processes manually:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -ti:3000
   
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

### If process won't start:

1. Check error message in UI (now more descriptive)
2. Verify project path exists
3. Check run command is correct
4. Look in runner logs for detailed error

### Database cleanup (if needed):

You can manually trigger cleanup via Node console:
```javascript
import { releaseAllPortAllocations } from '@sentryvibe/agent-core/lib/port-allocator';
await releaseAllPortAllocations();
```
