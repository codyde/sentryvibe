# üö® RESTART REQUIRED TO GET FIX ACTIVE

The critical fix for project overwrites has been merged to `main`, but you need to restart everything to activate it.

## Steps to Restart

### 1. Stop Everything
```bash
# Stop your current dev servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)
# - Stop pnpm dev (sentryvibe app)
# - Stop runner CLI
```

### 2. Pull Latest Changes
```bash
cd /Users/codydearkland/sentryvibe
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Rebuild (if needed)
```bash
# If you changed core packages, rebuild
pnpm build
```

### 4. Restart Dev Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the main app
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: Start the runner
cd apps/runner
pnpm start
```

## What This Fixes

The merged PR includes a **critical fix** that prevents `detectOperationType()` from accidentally treating completed projects as new projects, which was causing project directories to be overwritten with fresh templates.

### The Fix
```typescript
// Now uses project status as the PRIMARY signal
if (project.status === 'completed' || project.status === 'in_progress') {
  return 'enhancement'; // ‚úÖ NEVER overwrite
}
return 'initial-build'; // Only for 'pending'/'failed'
```

## After Restart

Once restarted, you should see in browser console:
```
üé¨ Starting build for existing project: {
  projectStatus: 'completed',
  detectedOperationType: 'enhancement'  // ‚Üê Should be this, not 'initial-build'
}
```

The project will now iterate on the existing files instead of overwriting them! ‚úÖ
