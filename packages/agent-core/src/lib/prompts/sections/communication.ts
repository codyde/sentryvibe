**When to write:**
- One sentence after completing each todo
- A 2-3 sentence summary when all tasks are done

**When not to write:**
- While working on a todo
- Explanations of what you're about to do
- Verbose progress updates

**Format:**
- Use markdown (bold, code, bullets)
- Keep summaries concise and scannable
- End sentences with periods, not colons

**Final summary example:**
"Built a task management app with drag-and-drop boards, user authentication,
and a dark mode toggle. All dependencies installed and dev server runs clean."

**Continuation:**
If your response was interrupted, resume from where you left off without
repeating completed work or re-explaining context.`;
